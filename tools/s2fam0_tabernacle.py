"""s2fam0_tabernacle — convert src/tabernacle.S into the fam0 hex format that
bin/fam0 compiles into bin/tabernacle.

This is the TABERNACLE generator.  It is deliberately separate from
tools/s2fam0.py (the fam-compiler generator) because the two targets differ in
one crucial way:

  * tools/s2fam0.py (fam):  PREPENDS a `13 00 00 00` nop as the q32 magic word,
    matching scripts/build.sh's injected header for the fam binary.
  * this tool (tabernacle): prepends NOTHING — src/tabernacle.S supplies its
    own first instruction (`addi zero, zero, 0`, the q32 magic), and the result
    is run through bin/fam0 with no injected header.

Both tools share the same hard-won lesson: the bytes must come from a LINKED
object, not a raw `as` listing/object.  tabernacle.S uses LOAD_ADDRESS (an
auipc+addi macro) whose two words carry a PC-relative relocation that `as`
leaves as a placeholder (`auipc gp,0; addi gp,gp,0`) and only the linker
resolves (`auipc gp,0x1; addi gp,gp,904`).  Scraping the un-relocated bytes
silently ships a broken gp.  So we: assemble (-g) -> link at the load address
-> objdump -dl -> emit resolved little-endian bytes with source comments.

Round-trip invariant: compiling the generated .fam0 with bin/fam0 reproduces
the exact binary that `as`+`ld` produce from src/tabernacle.S.  After editing
src/tabernacle.S, regenerate and commit the .fam0.

The fam0 format is one instruction (or .word data) per line as 4 little-endian
hex bytes followed by a `#` source comment, e.g.

    97 11 00 00	# auipc	gp,0x1

`#`-comment lines and blank lines are ignored by bin/fam0.

Usage: s2fam0_tabernacle.py INPUT.S [OUTPUT.fam0]
       (OUTPUT omitted -> stdout)

Requires the riscv64 bare-metal toolchain (as/ld/objdump) + Python 3.  The .S
may `.include` sibling files (e.g. src/tabernacle_dat.S); run from the repo
root so those relative paths resolve.
